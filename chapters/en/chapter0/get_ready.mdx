## Step 2. Get a Hugging Face account

If you don't yet have one, create a Hugging Face account (it's free). You'll need it to complete hands-on tasks, to
receive your certificate of completion, to explore pre-trained models, to access datasets and more.

## Step 3. Brush up on fundamentals (if you need to)

We assume that you are familiar with deep learning basics, and have general familiarity with transformers. If you need
to brush up on your understanding of transformers, check out our [NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1).

## Step 4. Check your setup

To go through the course materials you will need:
- A computer with an internet connection
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for hands-on exercises. The free version is enough. If you have never used Google Colab before, check out this [official introduction notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

<Tip>

As an alternative to the free tier of Google Colab, you can use your own local setup, or Kaggle Notebooks. Kaggle Notebooks 
offer a fixed number of GPU hours and have similar functionality to Google Colab, however, there are differences when it 
comes to sharing your models on ðŸ¤— Hub (e.g. for completing assignments). If you decide to use Kaggle Notebooks as your 
tool of choice, check out the [example Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/michaelshekasta/test-notebook) created by 
[@michaelshekasta](https://github.com/michaelshekasta). This notebook illustrates how you can train and share your 
trained model on ðŸ¤— Hub.
